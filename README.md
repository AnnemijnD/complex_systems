## MODEL 1: SPECIATION

To recreate the results from our first model, run 'spatial\experiments.py MODEL TYPE' (If pathing does not work, run 'experiments.py MODEL TYPE' directly from the spatial folder). For the MODEL variable, choose SYMPATRIC or ALLOPATRIC. For TYPE, choose STANDARD (recreate all figures from our presentation with smaller grid size and iterations to increase speed) or CUSTOM (input your own parameter values). The STANDARD options produces the followng results:

SYMPATRIC: 5 models, running time approximately 6 min. Four different model evolutions + 1 speciation time plot.
ALLOPATRIC: x models, running time approximately x min.

Final model states may vary due to the stochastic nature of the model. The CUSTOM options runs the basic models with custom input parameters.

## MODEL 2: MUTATION

To run the second model, run the cells from the 'non_spatial/Organism Mutation/Genes.ipynb' file in Jupyter Notebook. The parameters can be altered in the first cell. 

In the Analysis directory data for the plots and the plots themselves are given.
